# Introduction
In this repository I follow along with Karpathy's deep learning series ["Zero to Hero"](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html), and write notes and code.

# Overview
So far I completed the following parts of his lessons:

1. Micrograd  
  * Description:
    * We build a module from scratch which can do backpropagation and train neural networks
  * Links:
    * [Youtube-Lecture](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0)
	* [Karpathys-Github](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)
  * Files:
    * The outcome from the lecture has been written into the notebooks in the folder /notebooks/micrograd
	* The minimal code to reproduce the micrograd library has been exported from the notebooks to /modules/micrograd

2. Language Modelling: Part 1
  * Description:  
  	* We build a simple bigram character-level language model in pytorch
  * Links:
  	* [Youtube-Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo)
	* [Karpathys-Github](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore)
  * Files:
  	* A walkthrough of all the information given in the lecture has been written to notebook one in the folder /notebooks/bigram
	* The minimal code to reproduce the model training has been exported from the notebooks to /training/bigram

3. Language Modelling: Part 2
  * Description:
  	* We expand the previous character-level language model, but using more characters and by implementing a multilayer perceptron (MLP).

    * [Karpathys-Github](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore)
  * Files:
  	* A walkthrough of all the information given in the lecture has been written to notebook two in the folder /notebooks/bigram

4. Language Modelling: Part 3
5. Language Modelling: Part 4
6. Language Modelling: Part 5
7. GPT From Scratch
